## Functional Requirements

1. Search for Local and National Parks by Location
 - As a user, I want to be able to find parks near me by searching for local and national parks by location.
   - Example: Given that I live in Cincinnati, I can enter "Cincinnati, OH" as the location and the app should show me a list of parks within a 20-mile radius of the selected location.

2. Filter Park Search Results by Activity Type
 - As a user, I want to be able to find parks that offer the activities I am interested in by filtering park search results by activity type.
   - Example: When I'm interested in hiking, I can select "Hiking" as the activity type and then the app should show me a list of parks near my location that offer hiking trails.

3. View Details About a Specific Park
 - As a user, I want to be able to view detailed information about a specific park so I can plan my visit and decide which activities to do.
   - Example: Given that I'm interested in visiting Central Park in New York, I can select Central Park from the search results and the app should show me detailed information about the park, including its address, hours of operation, and a list of available activities.

4. Save Favorite Park
 - As a user, I want to be able to save my favorite parks for easy access later.
   - Example: Given that I've found a park I'm interested in visiting, I can save it as a favorite and the park will be added to my list of saved parks, which I can access at any time. If I try to add the same park again, the app should notify me that the park is already in my favorite list.
